# ThirdPersonCamera
A third person camera and character controller for Unity3D I worked on a year and a half ago, based on the tutorials by 3D Buzz.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add the TP_Controller script to your character, it will automatically add the remaining scripts.</li>
<li>Add the TP_Camera script to your camera.</li>
<li>Create an empty gameobject and make it a child of your character. This will be the pivot point for the camera.</li>
<li>Add a reference to the pivot point in the TP_Camera editor.</li>
</ol>
There is a demo scene included that shows the setup of the scripts.

<h2>TO DO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write full documentation on how to use the scripts, explaining each variable and function fully.</li>
<li>Change the legacy Animation component to mechanim for character animation.</li>
<li>Add more functionality to the camera.</li>
<li>Add more demo scenes.</li>
</ul>
